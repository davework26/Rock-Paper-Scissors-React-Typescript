# Rock, Paper, Scissors

My solution to the Rock Paper Scissors game from initial boilerplate code at https://github.com/ovotech/react-rps-boilerplate

These are the changes that I made to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game:

1. - [x] Completed game logic to randomly select computer choice and decide winner/loser/draw.
2. - [x] Display player and computer choices, adding their states to existing game state.
3. - [x] Created unit tests for game logic testing every combination of player and computer choices and game result.
